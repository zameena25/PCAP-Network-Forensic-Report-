## Files Included
- `XYZ.pcap` – Packet capture file used for the analysis
- `PCAP_Report.pdf` – Full detailed analysis report

## Tools Used
- Wireshark v4.4.3
- MAC Address Lookup
- Hashing Tools
- Email Header Analyzer

## Project Overview
The investigation focused on:
- Analyzing captured network traffic
- Identifying key devices and MAC addresses
- Tracing emails from anonymous services
- Verifying data integrity via hashing

The project demonstrates **network monitoring, packet analysis, and cybersecurity investigation skills**.
